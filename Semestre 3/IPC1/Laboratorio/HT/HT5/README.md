Cloud Computing <br>

In 2006 Amazon Web Services started to offer IT Services to the mases, 
this is what we nowadays know as Cloud Computing, but just what is "Cloud Computing"?
that is what we will learn today. <br>

Cloud Computing is an Internet based computing service in which large networks of servers
are used to allow for centralized data storage as well as online access to computer services
or resources, now this opens a whole new world of possibilities for enterprises
for example, Cloud service providers can enable a pay-as-you-go model in which you
only pay for the amount of resources that you're actually using, in other words, unlike
a normal array of PCs you buy for your enterprise to use, you only pay for exactly the amount
of resources that you need, so you can actually save money by not wasting any of the power
that you're not using, which is, in fact, wasted power that you paid for. Now that isn't the only
benefit, another major benefit is that you can access your work from anywhere as long as you have
a stable internet connection, which is rather practical if you are for example suddenly requested
to attend something on your project, and these aren't the only benefits, but they are the most important ones

Cloud Computing has five essential characteristics: <br><br>
-On-demand self-service: "A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network
storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service.<br><br>
provider." This checks if the Computing Capability can be provided without human interaction with the service provider.
-Broad network access: "Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that
promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms" This checks if the computing capability is available from a
wide range of locations using standard protocols.<br><br>
-Resource Pooling: "The providerâ€™s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model,
with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer.<br><br>
demand." This checks if the computing infrastructure is shared among more than one Customer using the same Provider's resources.<br><br>
-Rapid Elasticity: "Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly
outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for
provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time." This checks if the computing
capabilities can be rapidly provisioned and released to scale.<br><br>
-Measured Service: "Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability 1 at
some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service." This checks if the Cloud services characteristics including resource usage are
measured with enough detail to support the requirements of the
Customer.

Now, Cloud Computing isn't limited to a single type, there are different types of Cloud Computing
such as:<br><br>
 -Public Cloud: Data and Services are managed by the Service Providers Infrastructure.<br><br>
 -Private Cloud: Data and Services are managed by the organization only for that organization.<br><br>
 -Hybrid Cloud: This is a combination of Public and Private.<br><br>

Also there are different Cloud Computing Models, such as:<br><br>
 -Infrastructure As A Service(IaaS): It provides users with the ability to develop their own
  applications on resources such as: Processing, Storage, Network Connectivity.<br><br>
 -Platform As A Service(PaaS): It provides users with various pre-developed things like
  Databases, Queues, Workflow Engines, Email, etc.<br><br>
 -Software As A Service(SaaS): It provides users with End-User apps to use such as the ability
  to manage users and also some personalization options like getting to set their Corporate Logo, Colors, etc.<br><br><br>

So which one you're going to go for really depends on the needs of your enterprise.

But, up until now, we have discussed about what is Cloud Computing and it's types and models
but why would someone choose Cloud Computing over normal computing? I mean, we have talked about some benefits
but let me persuade you, for starters it is Cost Efficient because building what you need with your own tools and servers
is time consuming and very expensive, why build a new network of servers from the ground up if there's already one that you can
use anytime, anywhere? Also Reliability, a Cloud Computing provider gives you a much more managed, reliable and consistent service
than an in-house IT infrastructure, it guarantees 24/7 service for 365 days a year, and if a server fails then 
worry not! It can all be transferred to an other server very easily, so that everything is always within your reach when you need it.
Speaking of moving data, how much data can you store in the cloud? All the data you could ever want! Yes, that's right, you can have
Near Unlimited Cloud Storage! So that you can work without any worries (Some Providers will charge you more if you want more space
but it really depends on your provider), and since moving data from one server to another one  is so easy then you can Backup and Recover
your data very easily since you only need an Internet connection to access the server and you can download or upload the data from any
PC that you would like, and since you access it by Internet then you can access and manage your data from anywhere in the world! So it is
really convenient.

And just like everything else there are some disadvantages, there aren't a lot of Disadvantages though, we have some disadvantages such as:
Security Problems, you see, since a the servers can be accessed by the Internet then that means that there is always a risk of your data being stolen
even if the provider uses the best Security Standards out there, it's not as if it can be stolen easily but there is always a possibility
also there could be some technical problems since a lot of people and enterprises are using virtually the same hardware, so some times they
might exceed the server's capacity forcing some business processes to be temporarily suspended, and also the obvious problem that if you don't
have a stable Internet connection then you can't do anything in the Cloud, And also a big disadvantage is that it is not easy to switch
Cloud Providers because all the different Clouds operate in a different way, Providers try to make their platforms flexible so that you can
integrate programs from other Cloud Platforms more easily, but there's always a barrier between them, for example an App Developed on Microsoft
Development Network might not work on a platform developed on Linux.
